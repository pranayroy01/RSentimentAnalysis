RSentimentAnalysis
==================

Using R to perform sentiment analysis about opinion among people for movies Thor  , The counsellor ,Freebirds pre and post release
The main objective of this project is to perform Sentiment Analysis on tweets (Twitter Data)from users and gather insights about sentiments associated with movies. As when a movie from
a famous director or cast group approaches the release date, the social network gets stirred upwith messages and posts describing the feelings, expectations, sentiments, and excitement of
users. People start giving their opinions and view about everything related to a movie. From the point of view of the stakeholders of a movie (Director, producer or even the actors).It
is highly imperative to know the discussions around the movie and to get the overall sentiments or emotions as reading random tweets cannot give the clear picture. The social network hasopened exiting doors to gain insights about reviews, sentiments and emotions which seemed
impossible a few years back.
